## Accommodation

Once you are registered for the sprint, we'll get everyone the location of the villa and local contacts to organize the booking of nearby villas that cost ~200 EUR per person per week.

If you are planning to come with your family and/or stay longer, @Nejc Zupan has written a [remote worker's guide to Lanzarote](https://github.com/zupo/awesome-lanzarote).

## Food

We'll organize catering (breakfast and lunch) during the sprint. 

There are a ton of options for dinners in nearby restaurants.

## Registration

Closed, as we have reached our limit. We hope in the future there will be more of these events!

## Topics

To be determined once registration closes based on attendees interest.

## Travel

The best way to travel is [via a plane to Lanzarote airport](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhojagwIAxIIL20vMDk0N2wSCjIwMjEtMTEtMjdyBwgBEgNBQ0UaI2oHCAESA0FDRRIKMjAyMS0xMi0wM3IMCAMSCC9tLzA5NDdscAGCAQsI____________AUABSAGYAQE). It's also possible to fly to other island airports and then take a ferry (Fuertaventura is closest being 30min away).

## COVID-19

It's highly recommended that you vaccinate before coming to the sprint.

We will be staying outside most of the time. We'll be renting a pavilion tent for protection against the sun and the unfortunate droplet of rain. 

The temperature drops to a minimum of 15 C outside during the night so it's possible to have windows open.

Spain takes the pandemic very seriously, make sure to check up to date requirements before traveling.
